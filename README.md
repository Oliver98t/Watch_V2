# Watch_V2
Firmware, schematics and CAD files for an atmega328p based wristwatch 

Hi there, this watch is supposed to fill a nerdy need of mine and that is to simply display the time in binary format purely for my geek credibility.
The watch will go into a deep sleep after 10 seconds and can be reactivated with the left push button. The date and time is configurable and can also be displayed in decimal format. 


Have a great day!
