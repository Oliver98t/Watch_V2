# Watch_V2
Firmware and schematics for an atmega328p based wristwatch 

Hi there, this watch is supposed to fill a nerdy need of mine and that is to simply display the time in binary format purely for my geek credibility.
The watch will go into a deep sleep after 10 seconds and can be reactivated with the left push button. The date and time is configurable and can also display the time for
neurotypicals as well.

Have a great day!
